# Multi-Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) Techniques in Ontology Ranking

## Introduction
This project implements two Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) techniques, focusing on two Multi-Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) methods: **Elimination and Choice Expressing Reality (ELECTRE)** and **Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS)**.

This study implements and compares the performance of these techniques in ontology ranking. The dataset used in this project contains 50 ontologies and 11 quality metrics.

## Quality Metrics
The set of quality metrics used to evaluate the ontologies includes:

- **Absolute Root Cardinality (ARC)**: Quantifies the total number of root concepts in the ontology.
- **Absolute Leaf Cardinality (ALC)**: Measures the total count of leaf concepts.
- **Average Depth (AVD)**: Captures the average depth of concepts in the hierarchy.
- **Maximum Depth (MXD)**: Highlights the deepest level of specialisation.
- **Average Breadth (AVB)**: Indicates the average number of immediate children for each concept.
- **Maximum Breadth (MXB)**: Indicates the maximum number of immediate children for each concept.
- **Average Population (AVP)**: Reflects the average number of instances associated with each concept.
- **Class Richness (CR)**: Gauges the diversity of classes within the ontology.
- **Attribute Richness (AR)**: Gauges the diversity of attributes within the ontology.
- **Inheritance Richness (IR)**: Gauges the diversity of inheritance relationships within the ontology.
- **Relationship Richness (RR)**: Gauges the diversity of semantic associations within the ontology.

These metrics collectively provide a framework for assessing the quality and effectiveness of ontologies.
